# Technical test for a company : CDN VS Alexa Ranking
Technical Test for a company  - CDN vs Alexa Ranking

+ Will my Alexa ranking be affected (negatively) if I use a CDN to improve my site's availability and performance?
+ Will the CDN get all the traffic credit?
+ If not, is there a particular way I need to setup my site when wiring it to a CDN?
+ Does Alexa provide any insight on the above matter?
+ Let's assume I use CloudFlare (Company most likely will), does CloudFare comment on the above too?

No, your Alexa Ranking will not be affected negatively if you use a CDN to improve your site's availability and performance.
Alexa is a popularity contest pure and simple.

Alexa is junk. Only for the most active sites will the Alexa number mean anything. The reason is that Alexa has to extrapolate their results based upon a self-selective group. Who installs the Alexa toolbar anymore? Especially when they get a new computer? The Alexa audience is becoming narrower as fewer people install the toolbar and those who do fit within a smaller group of those who would.


+ The Alexa Toolbar is only compatible with 2/3 of the popular web browsers.
+ The Alexa Toolbar is largely incompatible with mobile search which is at least 1/3 of search.
+ Alexa cannot know about the statistical population of users who use browsers that are not supported by Alexa, mobile users, developing countries, non-Alexa users, and so on.
+ In statistical analysis, it is impossible to correct for biases using a population you do not know.
+ The Alexa Toolbar users are self-selective toward blog users, Twitter users, Facebook users, and other social media.
+ The Alexa Toolbar users are self-selective toward content and sites that are trend based and not research based.
+ The Alexa Toolbar users are self-selective away from research sites and search engine usage.
+ The Alexa Toolbar users trend toward popular topics/sites and those who concern themselves toward popular topics- this means a younger demographic and a demographic that does not include older or senior users.
